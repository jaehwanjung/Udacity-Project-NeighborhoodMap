# Neighborhood Map

###[PROJECT @ UDACITY]

July 5th, 2015

-----------------

###Project Overview
Develop a single page application featuring a map of a neighborhood. Add additional functionality to this map including highlighted locations, third-party data about those locations and various ways to browse the content.

### Learning Outcome
* Intro to AJAX
* JavaScript Design Patterns

### Structure
/app: contains all the source files
/dist: contains the outcome of a build done using Gulp. Minified, uglified, compressed, concatnated, etc.

### How-To
* Click on dist/index.html or app/index.html and start enjoying the app!
* The app will locate the user's current position upon loading and find popular venues around the location
* To change the neighborhood, enter a new address in the "Enter your address" input box
* To filter venues, enter a keyword in the "Type in a keyword to filter by..." input box. A typeahead list will appear and a keyword can be clicked. The venue list and the makers are updated real-time.
* The venue list contains all venues found. Clicking a venue will center the map around the clicked venue and open the info window. The venue list title includes the count of venues.
